# ðŸš€ Complete Bot Rebuild - Deployment Instructions

## The Problem
Your container is still running the old code that uses cogs, which causes the `CommandAlreadyRegistered` error.

## The Solution
You need to completely rebuild your container with the new code.

## Option 1: Using Portainer (Recommended)

1. **Go to Portainer** â†’ **Stacks**
2. **Stop and remove** your current stack
3. **Create a new stack** with these settings:
   - **Name**: `discord-bot`
   - **Repository URL**: `https://github.com/Bodii98/discord-tech-news-bot.git`
   - **Repository reference**: `main`
   - **Compose path**: `docker-compose.yml`
4. **Deploy the stack**

## Option 2: Using SSH/Command Line

If you have SSH access to your server:

```bash
# Navigate to your bot directory
cd /path/to/your/bot

# Stop and remove everything
docker-compose down
docker rmi discord-tech-news-bot:latest

# Pull latest code
git pull origin main

# Build fresh image (no cache)
docker-compose build --no-cache

# Start the bot
docker-compose up -d
```

## Option 3: Manual Container Rebuild

1. **In Portainer**:
   - Go to your container
   - Click "Stop"
   - Click "Delete"
   - Go to "Images"
   - Remove the old `discord-tech-news-bot` image
   - Go to "Stacks" and redeploy
